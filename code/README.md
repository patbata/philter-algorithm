# PhilterCode
The folder `PhilterCode` contains all of the files and scripts from the original [Philter GitHub repo](https://github.com/BCHSI/philter-ucsf).

# PhilterEvalPipeline
The folder `_PhilterEvalPipeline` contains the script used to evaluate how well philter performs against a golden standard annotation. For demonstration purposes, the folder contains fake notes that were annotated and ran through the philter algorithm (`/annotated/` and `/output/`) respectively. The results of the evaluation can be found in the Jupyter Notebook `PipelineDemo.ipynb`.
